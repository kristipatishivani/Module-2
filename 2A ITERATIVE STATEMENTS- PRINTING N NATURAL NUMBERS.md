# Exp. No: 2a ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING NUMBERS FROM M TO N
# Aim
To write a Python Program to print numbers range from M to N (including M and N values).

# Algorithm
Begin the program.
Read two integer inputs from the user and store them in m and n.
Use a for loop to iterate from m to n (inclusive).
In each iteration, print the current value of i.
Terminate the program.
